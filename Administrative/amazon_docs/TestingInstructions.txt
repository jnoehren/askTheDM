Some knowledge of Dungeons and Dragons is required for testing. Refer to the 5th edition Player's Handbook, or the spells listed here: https://www.dnd-spells.com/spells

You can invoke the app by saying "Alexa, ask the DM" followed by a question, or by saying "Alexa, open DM".

There are eleven custom intents in this version: ConditionsIntent, DiceIntent, ExhaustionLevelIntent, FeatsIntent, IndexIntent, ItemsIntent, SpellCastIntent, SpellDamageIntent, SpellHealIntent, and SpellsIntent.


Testing ConditionsIntent:
You can simply ask about the condition to get a description. Conditions include: blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, grappled, incapacitated, invisible, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned, and unconscious. 
You can ask questions like "Tell me about charmed", "I forgot how being grappled affects me", or "What are the effects of being blinded".


Testing DiceIntent:
This is a simple dice roller for 2,4,6,8,10,12,20, and 100 sided dice. You can ask questions like
"roll 2 d. 6", "roll 3 d. 12 plus 8", "roll a d. 20 with advantage".


Testing ExhaustionLevelIntent:
Exhaustion levels range from 1 to 6. Simply asking about exhaustion without providing any level is handled in ConditionsIntent.
You can ask questions like "What is level three of exhaustion?", "What does having level one exhaustion mean?", or "get information on level two exhaustion".


Testing FeatsIntent:
There are 42 feats. Some examples include crossbow expert, durable, keen mind, observant, and sharpshooter. Each feat has three attributes: benefits, description, and prerequisites. 
You can ask questions like "What does athlete do?", "Lookup benefits of ritual caster", or "Get info on the tough feat".


Testing IncompleteIntent:
This intent is for determining when Alexa doesn't hear the entirety of a phrase, as distinct from UnhandledIntent. It handles questions like "get the info about a", "how does having", and "tell us what".


Testing IndexIntent:
This mirrors a user looking up information in the index at the back of the handbook. This covers almost every subject in the 5th edition Player's Handbook. You can ask things like: "where can I find fireball", "what page is aspect of the beast on?" and "where can I find more information on conjuration".

Testing ItemsIntent:
You can ask about the following attributes for items: armor class, capacity, carry capacity, category, cost, damage, item type, properties, speed, strength, and weight.
You can ask questions about items like "How much does a sword cost?", "What is the armor class of a breastplate?", or "Tell me what a sling does".


Testing SpellCastIntent and SpellsIntent:
There are over 400 spells. A short list of spells you can ask about include: fireball, cure wounds, sleep, move earth, prismatic spray, and control weather. 

You can ask about the following attributes for spells: range, duration, casting time, short description, long description, components, spell slot(needed to cast requested spell) and school(of magic). 

You can ask questions about spells like "What is the range of fireball?", "How do I cast beacon of hope?", and "what's the duration of frostbite?".


Testing SpellDamageIntent and SpellHealIntent:
Healing and Damage are similar in form and function. Each spell has a level and a name. You can ask
questions like: "at level 1 how much damage does hellish rebuke do?", "how much damage does a 12th level vicious mockery do?", "how much damage does frostbite do at level 9?", "at level 2 how much h. p. does cure wounds restore?", "at level 2 how much healing does vampiric touch do?".
