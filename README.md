Ask the DM is a quick-reference tool designed for use during Dungeons and Dragons play sessions. The skill provides spell descriptions to players through a voice-command interface.

The core skill is a simple question-and-answer session. Users can get full spell descriptions, short descriptions, or single spell attributes such as casting time or range.
